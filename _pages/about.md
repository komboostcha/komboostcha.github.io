        <p>I am Camila, Brazilian living in Ireland since 2016, Food Engineer and passionate about the fermentation process. I used to work in a brewery company and that is when my passion started.</p>
        <p>In March 2018, I was overweight and I decided to change my lifestyle. I started doing exercises everyday and changed my diet, eating healthier, making better choices. I lost 16kg in one year and a half. During this journey I was trying to find an alternative healthy drink and that's when I discovered kombucha.</p>
        <p>So I did a kombucha brewing course and discovered the incredible art to produce kombucha. Then I started to search, read more and do more courses to improve my knowledge about this delicious and healthy drink. And after all I have found out, it wouldn't be fair not to share with the world.</p>
