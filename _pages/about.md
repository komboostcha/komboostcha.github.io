    title: "The person behind the Komboostcha"
    excerpt: "I am Camila, Brazilian living in Ireland since 2016, Food Engineer and passionate about the fermentation process. I used to work in a brewery company and that is when my passion started.
    
    In March 2018, I was overweight and I decided to change my lifestyle. I started doing exercises everyday and changed my diet, eating healthier, making better choices. I lost 16kg in one year and a half. During this journey I was trying to find an alternative healthy drink and that's when I discovered kombucha.
    
    So I did a kombucha brewing course and discovered the incredible art to produce kombucha. Then I started to search, read more and do more courses to improve my knowledge about this delicious and healthy drink. And after all I have found out, it wouldn't be fair not to share with the world."
